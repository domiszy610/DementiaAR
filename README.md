Mobile activation game that employs augmented reality technology. The target audience is patients suffering from neurological problems. The game involves solving mazes by rotating them in augmented reality space so that the ball drops into the hole. During the development, a group of healthy seniors was first asked to play and rate the game. The outcome of the survey was used to improve the interface. The final version of the game was evaluated in the group of patients of św. Elżbieta Nursing Home in Ruda Śląska. The results indicate that the game is engaging and rewarding for the patients. The patients expressed a willingness to play this or a similar game again. The positive reception of the game and the inclusion of the maze-solving stimulation task suggests that the game could be used in activating various patients suffering from neurological problems.
